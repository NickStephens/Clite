Producing JVM Byte Code for CliteF
----------------------------------

Jan 12, 2013

Questions:
a. When in the compiling process should byte code be produced?
b. What kind of formatting or boiler plate do I need to abide by?

a. Probably in Semantic Interpretation

Conceptual Details:
-Need to write to a file
-Need to be able to extract type of values and variables (JVM has type-specific instructions)
-Need to be able to statically determine stack size and local size of a function
-Need to be able to generically translate high-level control structures into their low-level equivalents

Implementation Details:
-All meaning functions should begin writing to the file passed to it.
	or
-All meaning functions should begin returning strings
-Write JVM boilerplate in M(Program)

-Creating new class JasminFile, which is a descendent of Java Lib File

All functions will be static, and the amount and types of their arguments must be deterministic.
